Functional Programming Talk
=============

This repository contains the slides (in PDF format) and demo source code.

All of the source code is runnable (a few of the scala files have intentional compile
errors for demonstration purposes that are commented out). The .sc files are scala worksheets
that will work in the Scala IDE. 

Running the demo code
----------

All of the code can be opened and executed in open-source tools.

- The clj files are most easily loaded into LightTable
  Use CTRL-SPACE, type: Toggle Workspace Tree, Drag-n-drop files, 
  CTRL-SPACE Make editor instarepl.
- The hs files are most easily loaded and run via the GHCI REPL
  ghci fib.hs
- The scala files are most easily run by importing the pom.xml in IntelliJ
  (even the free edition) with the Scala plugin.
  The worksheets (.sc files) open an interactive REPL.
